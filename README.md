# Wow Such Program

This program is very simple, it connects to a MySQL database based on the following env vars:
* MYSQL_HOST
* MYSQL_USER
* MYSQL_PASS
* MYSQL_PORT

And exposes itself on port 9090:
* On `/healthcheck` it returns an OK message, 
* On GET it returns all recorded rows.
* On POST it creates a new row.
* On PATCH it updates the creation date of the row with the same ID as the one specified in query parameter `id`
